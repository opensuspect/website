*One amongst us is not like the rest*

OpenSuspect is an open source online social deduction game, like mafia.

OpenSuspect aims to be easily modifiable, however, our first maps are going to be focused around cold war themes.

This project is in *very early stage* development.
Interested to get involved? We'd love to hear from you.

## About the project
The OpenSuspect project is a team endevour of many volunteers. Our members work on the project in their spare time, often after work or school, so we don't have a rushed development schedule. Many of us regard the project as valuable experience in not just software development but also in team work. Our most important goals during development:
* Supportive community
* Openness
* Keeping extensibiliy in mind
* Focus on learning

However, we also understand that a game needs a direction, and some problems are easiest to solve in a top-down fashion. Therefore, we agreed to implement a team structure, where each team have their responsibilities, and are organized by an elected team leader. The project is guided by the council containing the team leaders and a few elected project coordinators, who set the goals together. For the current teams and leadership, check the CONTRIBUTORS file.
