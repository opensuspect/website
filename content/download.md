### Install Instructions:

The game is still in beta, so there are no compiled versions. To install the game, do the following

1. Download the Godot game engine

Get the game engine executable, and then run it

2. Get git-lfs

Opensuspect uses git-lfs for file handling, so you need to install that for your OS.

<https://git-lfs.github.com/>

3. Clone the git repo

Download git if you dont have it already, and do the following:
```
git clone https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect.git
```
4. Configure Godot

Open up godot, and hit import project. Select the src folder inside of the opensuspect folder you just got. Select Opensuspect, hit edit to import the assets, and hit the play button in the corner.
