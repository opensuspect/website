Hey whats up it’s orangemn6 here! Today I’ve come to write Devlog 6. So as you probably know we have a new website at [opensuspect.com](https://opensuspect.com) made by yours truly. Also, we have a new twitter account, @opensuspect. Get ready for us to dis among us every day. We also have a lot of new news, so let’s get right in!

### PR 217

So PR 217 destroyed everything. The end. (It will probably be fixed before I finish writing this though)

### New Character Design

For the character design, we now have a new character design idea! instead of having characters, we have started designing clothes and monocles and other stuff. ![picture](https://matrix-client.matrix.org/_matrix/media/r0/download/matrix.org/KAcwCUusOVqAdCagKMwLnguY) We are hoping to get an alpha out soon, and one of the features will be the characters and items.

### Other Stuff

So in other news, we will be posting the devlogs on the website, so you can stay tuned there also!
