Hey everyone, it's Cukmekerb, here to give you another devlog. It's been a while since we've published anything here, but we have made quite a bit of progress in the last month. For one thing, character customization is now in the game thanks to a few recent pull requests, and an even better version of the customization system is being worked on by Nice Micro.

As well as this, the game now has a lobby, which looks very nice and was made by jngo102.

However, we have yet to create a real level, any polished-feeling tasks, a victory/failure screen, and many other missing features which can all be found on our [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect/issues), so if you want to help us out, Join us on [Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/+among_us:matrix.org), [Discord](https://discord.gg/h4AXwK5nnX) or [Nextcloud](https://nextcloud.opensuspect.com/), clone the [repo](https://github.com/opensuspect/opensuspect) and make a PR, or say hi on our [Subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSuspect/).
