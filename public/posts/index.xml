			<description>Hey, Iâ€™m TheSecondReal0, and Iâ€™ll be writing the devlog this week.
Art

Despite earlier setbacks, the art team is back on track! The character design has been decided upon (see above), along with the lobby design! As always, the lobby design was decided upon with a vote, see submissions below.
Moxvallix&amp;rsquo;s submission:
Luke_Connor&amp;rsquo;s submission:
NiceMicro&amp;rsquo;s submission:
Luke_Connorâ€™s design won, although the final lobby will probably be more of a mix between his and Moxvallixâ€™s.</description>

<p>Luke_Connorâ€™s design won, although the final lobby will probably be more of a mix between his and Moxvallixâ€™s.</p>
<p><strong>Game Design</strong></p>
<p>The game design team had quite a productive meeting, we decided what the first map should be and how the game will play out. Like Among Us, there will be social deduction along with tasks. The first map will be a secret laboratory, where the â€œgood guysâ€ will complete tasks and vote out â€œbad guys,â€ and the â€œbad guysâ€ will try to kill all of the good guys. This first map is more of a proof of concept for OpenSuspect, we have plans for more maps and unique gamemodes down the road.</p>
<p>For me, the most interesting parts of this map are items and maintenance tasks. Certain tasks will need you to pick up a certain item to finish them. This introduces a new layer of gameplay, as it creates a new type of task for the â€œgoodâ€ team to do and it offers new opportunities for the â€œevilâ€ team, like hiding the items somewhere on the map. Maintenance tasks also bring new and interesting possibilities. An example of a maintenance task would be a tank where you need to maintain a constant pressure. The pressure will gradually change over time, so it must be periodically corrected by the players. Perhaps an â€œevilâ€ spy could adjust the pressure to be a little too high?</p>
<p>A comprehensive gameplay document can be found <a href="https://github.com/opensuspect/design-document/blob/main/general_gameplay.md">on GitHub</a></p>
<p><strong>Programming</strong></p>
<p>The programming team has been hard at work in the last week, adding spawn points, task assignment, and some UI improvement. Additionally, tools have been created to make map prototyping easy, and OpenSuspect now has keybind options!</p>
<p><strong>Come join us!</strong></p>
<p>Weâ€™d love to have you on the team, join us on <a href="https://matrix.to/#/#opensuspect:matrix.org">Matrix!</a></p>

			<description>Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s me. I&amp;rsquo;m theslaughterbehindtheman. Now that Moxxy has been bound and gagged relieved of his duty, I will be doing the devlog from here.
So, big stuff that&amp;rsquo;s happened. We now have our first task, which is a huge milestone, since all of the logic behind it can be reused for all the other ones. We sorta chose a theme, lobby, etc. Our lobby is going to be a train with a moving background.</description>

<p>So, big stuff that&rsquo;s happened. We now have our first task, which is a huge milestone, since all of the logic behind it can be reused for all the other ones. We sorta chose a theme, lobby, etc. Our lobby is going to be a train with a moving background. Our theme is and I quote &ldquo;60&rsquo;s Berlin Spy&rdquo; we did have a design for the character, but that brings us to our next point.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the art team has faced some setbacks, and the character design is still under work. We will report back when that is sorted out!</p>
<p>Timeline:</p>
<p>We expect an beta (or at least an alpha) to be released sometime in November or December, due to the pace things are going.</p>
<p>Accessibility:</p>
<p>We are looking for anyone who could help us out testing our colour-blind filters! We saw how Among Us was difficult for those with colour-blindness to play, and we have decided to make colour-blind accessibility a priority. If you have a type of colour-blindness, we would love for you to test our filters, so that we can make sure that they work as expected. Contact us on matrix at #opensuspect:matrix.org!</p>
<p>ok byeeee</p>

			<description>Greetings all, and welcome to the second Devlog, written by none other than yours truly, Moxvallix.
Recently, I posted Devlog #1, discussing the beginnings of our project, what our project aims to be, and the different teams that were formed to tackle various elements of the game&amp;rsquo;s design. Recently, the team leaders met to discuss important topics about the design of the game, which is why I have decided to make a second Devlog, for those who want to stay updated.</description>

<p>Recently, I posted Devlog #1, discussing the beginnings of our project, what our project aims to be, and the different teams that were formed to tackle various elements of the game&rsquo;s design. Recently, the team leaders met to discuss important topics about the design of the game, which is why I have decided to make a second Devlog, for those who want to stay updated. In the future, these Devlogs are to be handled by the Branding team, and will come out most likely on a weekly basis, and will be cross-posted to our subreddit, r/OpenSuspect.</p>
<h2 id="the-council-of-elders-has-spoken">The Council of Elders has spoken</h2>
<p>NiceMicro, Monban, Slaughter, Gobbel and yours truly were at attendance of this weeks leader meeting. First on the agenda was the design plan of the lobby; we are designing the lobby first, as it is a good first milestone to work towards, and allows the game development team to work on a design plan, whilst the other teams work on the lobby. We decided, based on a survey conducted by Gobbel, that the lobby for the first map, which is to be of the theme &ldquo;1960s Berlin Spy&rdquo;<strong>,</strong> would be set on a train, which would pull up to the map as the game would start. This cutscene of the train pulling in to the map would be where the player roles would be revealed.</p>
<p>We then discussed the roadmap for the project. Some areas discussed in the roadmap were getting a match making system working, what various roles could we have, and how we could innovate on the task system that is used in Among Us. An important goal is that we remain separate from Among Us, making sure that we innovate, rather than clone. One particular aspect we considered was how we could reinvent the death system prevalent across the social deduction genre, so it would not be boring. We considered alternative goals for the impostors, that did not involve killing. Many of these features will be cemented in the upcoming design document, which will be free for the community to access.</p>
<p>On the art side of things, it was suggested that the map be set in a seaside town in Germany, as it could be quite pretty to design. The art team is yet to decide the map style. In fact, the art team will be having a public vote for the design of the characters, which will effect the style of the rest of the game. Make sure to check r/OpenSuspect in the next day or two, and keep your eyes out for a link to the survey!</p>
<p>The project plans to move to NextCloud for all it&rsquo;s productivity benefits. Monban has kindly set up hosting, and migration will begin shortly. Matrix will still be our primary chat platform. Also, Monban has registered opensuspect.com, which is to be our official domain name.</p>
<p>We finished the meeting discussing finances, a boring and confusing subject, no doubt. As further down the line we plan to host a main server for the game, we will need to consider funding for said server, which may include setting up a Patreon, for people that wanted to support the project. OpenSuspect is under the GNU GPLv3 license, and will always be free, Patreon would be an optional donation.</p>
<p>That is all for the Devlog today, make sure to stick around, as we are making progress. If you would like to become an alpha tester, make sure you join the subreddit, and we&rsquo;ll keep you up to date when a pre-release is ready to test. Otherwise, check out NiceMicro&rsquo;s new video on the project:</p>

			<description>Welcome to the first Devlog of OpenSuspect! Written by none other than me, Moxvallix! (Soon to be written by the Branding Team!)
It has been two weeks since the project first started, when NiceMicro first posted to r/linuxmasterrace, and I set up a Matrix community for the few that were interested. Since then, following a few more Reddit posts, the idea for making an open source, Among Us inspired game, gained some traction, and soon development had started (a lot quicker than Micro and I had expected).</description>

<p>It has been two weeks since the project first started, when NiceMicro first posted to r/linuxmasterrace, and I set up a Matrix community for the few that were interested. Since then, following a few more Reddit posts, the idea for making an open source, Among Us inspired game, gained some traction, and soon development had started (a lot quicker than Micro and I had expected). We had a meeting to decide the future of the game, then held elections to nominate leaders of the different teams.</p>
<p>Currently, the game has working multiplayer. Gameplay is limited to walking around, but that will change once the game design document is presented to the group. The art team is working on designs for the character, of which an audition is being held, auditions will be showcased below. Translations have also been implemented into the game, the menu now has many different languages to choose from. Whilst still early in development, the current state of the game and community seems promising, and I am sure that a game soon will emerge. I mean, in this short time we already have 386 commits! Wow!</p>
<p>Make sure to stick around, and be ready to test the Alpha when it is released! You won&rsquo;t regret it! Make sure you have joined our subreddit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSuspect/">https://www.reddit.com/r/OpenSuspect/</a>, to keep up with the latest news. Make sure as well to check out NiceMicro&rsquo;s update video on the game:</p>

<p>An apple is a sweet, edible fruit produced by an apple tree (Malus pumila). Apple trees are cultivated worldwide, and are the most widely grown species in the genus Malus. The tree originated in Central Asia, where its wild ancestor, Malus sieversii, is still found today. Apples have been grown for thousands of years in Asia and Europe, and were brought to North America by European colonists. Apples have religious and mythological significance in many cultures, including Norse, Greek and European Christian traditions.<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></p>
