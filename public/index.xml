      <description>Big upgrades are being constantly delivered to the OpenSuspect project!
This week, it&amp;rsquo;s me, Nice Micro, the initial mastermind behind starting the game, who&amp;rsquo;s delivering you the news on the development progress. It has been a busy two weeks, and there was no rest for the coders, and big chunks of new code have been pulled into the main repository.
New updates Task information display Thanks to the great work of Damjan94, now the tasks assigned to the player appear in a dedicated task view HUD element.</description>

      <description>Customization 101 Hey everyone, it&amp;rsquo;s Cukmekerb, here to give you another devlog. It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we&amp;rsquo;ve published anything here, but we have made quite a bit of progress in the last month. For one thing, character customization is now in the game thanks to a few recent pull requests, and an even better version of the customization system is being worked on by Nice Micro. As well as this, the game now has a lobby, which looks very nice and was made by jngo102.</description>

      <description>Hey whats up it’s orangemn6 here! Today I’ve come to write Devlog 6. So as you probably know we have a new website at opensuspect.com made by yours truly. Also, we have a new twitter account, @opensuspect. Get ready for us to dis among us every day. We also have a lot of new news, so let’s get right in!
PR 217 So PR 217 destroyed everything. The end. (It will probably be fixed before I finish writing this though)</description>

      <description>Hi all, Moxvallix here, writing yet another Devlog!
It has been an interesting week for the OpenSuspect project. We have made progress, in Programming, and in Branding. We have had some new recruits join our ranks, and we have unfortunately had a team leader step down.
Firstly, thanks to @orangemn6, the OpenSuspect website has had an update. It now sports a much cleaner interface, with a grey background, ready to be swapped out for images of gameplay (when they come, of course).</description>

      <description>Hey, Iâ€™m TheSecondReal0, and Iâ€™ll be writing the devlog this week.
Art

Despite earlier setbacks, the art team is back on track! The character design has been decided upon (see above), along with the lobby design! As always, the lobby design was decided upon with a vote, see submissions below.
Moxvallix&amp;rsquo;s submission:
Luke_Connor&amp;rsquo;s submission:
NiceMicro&amp;rsquo;s submission:
Luke_Connorâ€™s design won, although the final lobby will probably be more of a mix between his and Moxvallixâ€™s.</description>

      <description>Hey, it&amp;rsquo;s me. I&amp;rsquo;m theslaughterbehindtheman. Now that Moxxy has been bound and gagged relieved of his duty, I will be doing the devlog from here.
So, big stuff that&amp;rsquo;s happened. We now have our first task, which is a huge milestone, since all of the logic behind it can be reused for all the other ones. We sorta chose a theme, lobby, etc. Our lobby is going to be a train with a moving background.</description>

      <description>Greetings all, and welcome to the second Devlog, written by none other than yours truly, Moxvallix.
Recently, I posted Devlog #1, discussing the beginnings of our project, what our project aims to be, and the different teams that were formed to tackle various elements of the game&amp;rsquo;s design. Recently, the team leaders met to discuss important topics about the design of the game, which is why I have decided to make a second Devlog, for those who want to stay updated.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the first Devlog of OpenSuspect! Written by none other than me, Moxvallix! (Soon to be written by the Branding Team!)
It has been two weeks since the project first started, when NiceMicro first posted to r/linuxmasterrace, and I set up a Matrix community for the few that were interested. Since then, following a few more Reddit posts, the idea for making an open source, Among Us inspired game, gained some traction, and soon development had started (a lot quicker than Micro and I had expected).</description>

      <description>One amongst us is not like the rest
OpenSuspect is an open source online social deduction game, like mafia.
OpenSuspect aims to be easily modifiable, however, our first maps are going to be focused around cold war themes.
This project is in very early stage development. Interested to get involved? We&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you. Join us at #opensuspect:matrix.org on a Matrix client (element.io). If you need tech support, use our troubleshooting channel.</description>
